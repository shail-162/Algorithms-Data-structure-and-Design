/**
 * Convert array into Zig-Zag fashion
 * Given an array of DISTINCT elements, rearrange the elements of array in zig-zag fashion in O(n) time.
 * The converted array should be in form a < b > c < d > e < f.
 * Example:
 * Input:  arr[] = {4, 3, 7, 8, 6, 2, 1}
 * Output: arr[] = {3, 7, 4, 8, 2, 6, 1}
 *
 * Input:  arr[] =  {1, 4, 3, 2}
 * Output: arr[] =  {1, 4, 2, 3}
 *
 *
 * A Simple Solution is to first sort the array. After sorting, exclude the first element, swap the remaining elements in pairs.
 * (i.e. keep arr[0] as it is, swap arr[1] and arr[2], swap arr[3] and arr[4], and so on).
 * Time complexity is O(nlogn) since we need to sort the array first.
 *
 * We can convert in O(n) time using an Efficient Approach. The idea is to use modified one pass of bubble sort.
 * Maintain a flag for representing which order(i.e. < or >) currently we need.
 * If the current two elements are not in that order then swap those elements otherwise not.
 * Let us see the main logic using three consecutive elements A, B, C.
 * Suppose we are processing B and C currently and the current relation is ‘<'.
 * But we have B > C. Since current relation is ‘<' previous relation must be '>‘ i.e., A must be greater than B.
 * So, the relation is A > B and B > C. We can deduce A > C. So if we swap B and C then the relation is A > C and C < B.
 * Finally we get the desired order A C B
